# ToiletThoughts
Second team app off App Academy bootcamp course made in collaboration with Fouad Astitou 

Toilet Thoughts is a project made by students of the App Academy for Taug√© TV, a online youtube channel. They use the app to get inspiration from what people think when they are in the bathroom. Also it displays the movies of the online youtube channel. It lets users log in to upload or see what they have uploaded. Also it allows users to remove Toilet Thoughts and score other users thoughts up and down. 

The app is mainly written in Objective C with other files being transformed to Swift via a bridging header. It is designed and written over a period of four weeks.
